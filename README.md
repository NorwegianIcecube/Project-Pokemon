Project Pokemon is an experiment in VGC simulation. It is intended to be a fully functional battle simulator, and an AI model that can interact with the simulator in a way that will teach it to play the game, so that it can be used in a genetic algorithm to evolve a team of Pokemon that can win battles. The project is currently in the early stages of development, and is not yet functional.
